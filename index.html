    Radioactivity

  <p class="text">
    Radioactivity is the emission of high energy particles from certain atoms. This is caused when the nucleus of an atom disintegrates, or falls apart.
    When this happens, proton, neutron, and electron numbers in the atom become unstable. Instability is the main thing for radioactivity. Radioactivity can be dangerous, depending of the type of disintegration that happens.
    Alpha particles aren't really that dangerous, unless we ingest it. Ingest means to put it inside our bodies. Beta particles can penetrate a few layers of our skin, and can do some damage. Gamma rays are the highest energy emissions, which can penetrate
    our skin and even mess up our DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid.
