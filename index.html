    Radioactivity is the emission of high energy particles from certain atoms. This is caused when the nucleus of an atom disintegrates, or falls apart.
    When this happens, proton, neutron, and electron numbers in the atom become unstable. Instability is the main thing for radioactivity. Radioactivity can be dangerous, depending of the type of disintegration that happens.
    Alpha particles aren't really that dangerous, unless we ingest it. Ingest means to put it inside our bodies. Beta particles can penetrate a few layers of our skin, and can do some damage. Gamma rays are the highest energy emissions, which can penetrate
    our skin and even mess up our DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid. Radioactivity is useful for some inventions, like X-rays or smoke detectors. However, X-rays for your teeth are not used in big amounts. Doctors are very careful while using radiation for X-rays.
    And for the airport, there are warning signs, telling you that there is radiation and you need to stay away. One type of smoke detector detects radiation in smoke, which alerts you to stay away.
    There are many isotopes of radioactive atoms, which are basically the same atoms with different neutron amounts. Take uranium-238, the most common isotope. Another isotope is uranium-234, which has 4 less neutrons than uranium-238.
